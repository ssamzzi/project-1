# Primer Tm Curation

## When to use
Use this guide when selecting primer pairs for PCR/qPCR. Compare multiple Tm estimates from validated calculator methods.

## Common input mistakes
- Ignoring sequence length and GC content differences.
- Using non-default salt assumptions without recording it.
- Entering Tm directly and then converting units manually.

## Interpretation pitfalls
- Different algorithms can differ by several degrees.
- Long runs with secondary structures need context-specific tuning.

## Recommended tools
- Primer3: fast design suggestions (simple, quick).
- OligoCalc: good for quick check (fast learning curve).
- ThermoFisher Tm calculators: protocol aligned with their kits.

## Disclaimer
Primer-Tm formulas use approximations and assumptions about salt and oligo model.
