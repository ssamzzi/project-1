# Osmolarity Curation

## When to use
Use this when checking buffer compatibility for cells and enzymes.

## Common input mistakes
- Mixing mOsm/kg and mOsm/L assumptions.
- Forgetting temperature and density differences.
- Adding osmolytes without adjusting osmolarity.

## Interpretation pitfalls
- Osmolarity estimates do not replace full experimental verification.
- Different solute dissociation states shift effective osmolarity.

## Recommended tools
- Henderson reference style tables: quick manual check.
- Spreadsheet calculations: transparent audit.
- External osmolarity calculators: easy entry.

## Alternative links in case of login/JS issues
- Public physiology resources.
- Journal methods sections with measured media values.

## Disclaimer
Estimate values are context-limited; check with reagent datasheet ranges.
