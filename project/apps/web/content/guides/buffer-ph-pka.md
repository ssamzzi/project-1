# Buffer pH / pKa

## When to use
Use this when preparing or selecting a buffer for enzymatic reactions.

## Common input mistakes
- Ignoring ionic strength.
- Using buffer outside intended pH range.
- Selecting a buffer with weak capacity near pH transition.

## Interpretation pitfalls
- Same pH reading does not guarantee same buffering capacity.
- Temperature change can shift pH with weak buffers.

## Recommended tools
- pKa lookup table (paper references): fast reference for chemistry planning.
- OpenBabel calculators: conversion convenience.
- Lab notebook checklists: robust tracking.

## Alternative links in case of login/JS issues
- Official product specification sheets.
- Public molecular biology manuals.

## Disclaimer
pH and pKa interpretation depends on exact temperature and ionic condition.
