# Statistical Test Chooser

## When to use
Use this for deciding a first-pass statistical comparison among labs and experiments.

## Common input mistakes
- Wrong pairing of repeated measures with independent tests.
- Omitting test assumptions (normality/variance equality).
- Using one-tailed without pre-registered hypothesis.

## Interpretation pitfalls
- p-value is not effect size.
- Multiple testing increases false positives and should be corrected.

## Recommended tools
- R ggpubr scripts: transparent pipeline (open-source, code based).
- GraphPad Prism: fast GUI analysis (fast for small team workflows).
- Python SciPy: reproducible and scriptable.

## Alternative links in case of login/JS issues
- Public method guides from official statistics portals.
- Textbook chapters on experimental design.

## Disclaimer
Different labs may require specific handling for paired tests or mixed models.
